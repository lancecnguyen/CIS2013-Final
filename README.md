# CIS2013-Final
Final

1. My favorite part of the class is the teacher with a lot of knowledge in the field. Giving
students a lot of information how to get better in the field, and how to connect it with life.

2. My least favorite part of the class if the in class quiz, I think it is a waste of roughly
30-45 minutes. I do understand that we must have quizs in the class but how the quiz works. 
Because many students don't have basic programming skills, a quiz on mostly new codes are tough
for the student.

3. It would be much nicer if the class goes a little bit slower. The teacher work through 2-3 
programming problems from the book with the class. Explaining how to approach and work on the
program.
